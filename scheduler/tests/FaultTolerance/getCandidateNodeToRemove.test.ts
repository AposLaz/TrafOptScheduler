 * Scenario 5: All zones have exactly one replica
Input: Each zone has exactly one replica.
Expected Output: The function should return the most loaded node from any zone.
Scenario 6: One zone has the highest replica count
Input: One or more zones have more replicas than others.
Expected Output: The most loaded node from the most populated zone should be selected.
Scenario 7: No zones have sufficient replicas to remove
Input: All zones have only one node with replicas.
Expected Output: The function should return the most loaded node.

  //   ✅ Scenario 1: All zones have exactly one replica
  // Input: 3 zones, each with one replica

  // Expected Output: The most loaded node from any zone (based on CPU/Memory usage or custom weights)

  // test('Scenario 1: All zones have exactly one replica', () => {
  //   // Should return the node with highest usage among node1, node2, node3
  // });
  // ✅ Scenario 2: One zone has more replicas than others
  // Input: Zone-1 has 3 replicas, Zone-2 has 1, Zone-3 has 1

  // Expected Output: The most loaded node from Zone-1

  // test('Scenario 2: One zone is more populated', () => {
  //   // Should select the most loaded node in Zone-1
  // });
  // ✅ Scenario 3: All zones have a single node with replicas
  // Input: Each zone has only 1 node and 1 replica

  // Expected Output: The most loaded node among them

  // test('Scenario 3: Only one replica per zone', () => {
  //   // Should still return the most loaded node
  // });
  // ✅ Scenario 4: One node is much more loaded than others
  // Input: All zones balanced in replica count, but one node is overloaded

  // Expected Output: That overloaded node should be returned

  // test('Scenario 4: One node is significantly overloaded', () => {
  //   // Should select the overloaded node, even if zone replica count is even
  // });
  // ✅ Scenario 5: Only one zone has multiple nodes
  // Input: Zone-1 has multiple nodes and replicas, others have one node

  // Expected Output: Most loaded node from Zone-1 if it has most replicas

  // test('Scenario 5: Zone with more nodes', () => {
  //   // Should select the most loaded from zone with max replicas
  // });
  // ✅ Scenario 6: All nodes heavily loaded but in different zones
  // Input: All nodes have similar replicas, but load varies significantly

  // Expected Output: Most loaded node regardless of zone

  // test('Scenario 6: Equal replicas, uneven resource usage', () => {
  //   // Most loaded node should be selected
  // });
  // ✅ Scenario 7: Weighted usage type (CPU vs Memory vs Combined)
  // Input: Replica distribution is same, load differs depending on metric type

  // Expected Output: Selected node depends on the weight configuration

  // test('Scenario 7: Metric weights affect node choice', () => {
  //   // Depending on metric type and weight, node selection will change
  // });
  // ✅ Scenario 8: All zones have same replica count but different number of nodes
  // Input: Zone-1 has 3 nodes, Zone-2 and Zone-3 have 1 each

  // Expected Output: Still select the most loaded node from a zone with the highest replica count

  // test('Scenario 8: More nodes in a zone with same replicas', () => {
  //   // Should consider replica count not node count
  // });
