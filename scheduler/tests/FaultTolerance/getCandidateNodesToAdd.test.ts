/**
 * Test Cases for getCandidateNodesToAdd
Scenario 1: Nodes have sufficient resources and are evenly distributed
Input: Nodes have resources available, and zones have an even number of replicas.
Expected Output: The method should return nodes that maintain even distribution across zones.
Scenario 2: Some zones lack resources
Input: At least one zone lacks nodes with enough available resources.
Expected Output: The returned candidate nodes should only come from zones with available resources.
Scenario 3: Deployment replicas are fewer than zones
Input: The number of replicas is less than the number of zones.
Expected Output: The function should prioritize zones that currently have zero replicas.
Scenario 4: Nodes are unevenly distributed
Input: Some zones have significantly more replicas than others.
Expected Output: The function should prioritize zones with the fewest replicas.
