// 5. Upstream nodes with no latency data:
// Simulate nodes that are upstream but donâ€™t have corresponding entries in nodesLatency.

// Useful for testing robustness in:

// ts
// Copy
// Edit
// if (!latency) { ... }
// ðŸ“Œ Expected: fallback to latency: 0 or LFU.

// 6. Nodes with no upstream RPS but are eligible
// Add a test where one of the candidate nodes is not present in the upstream graph (maybe a newer node just added).

// ðŸ“Œ Expected: Test fallback to LFU or default scoring.

// 7. High number of upstream nodes (>3â€“5)
// You cover 5 and 7 in existing cases, but a really high count (e.g., 10 nodes, mixed RPS/latency) could test the sorting and weighting logic under complexity.

// 8. Equal weights:
// Scenario where latency and RPS weights lead to a tie.

// ðŸ“Œ Expected: Check whether sort is stable or fallback logic is applied (like Math.random() or consistent fallback to LFU).
